Getting started

1. Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed
2. Run the command "npm install"
3. Run the command "grunt" for compiling sass files
4. Go to http://localhost:3000

About Assignment
I have used the following technologies
Node.js, Express and the template engine "jade" with SASS , jQuery and Grunt.
Free Geolocation API from Google Maps.
Typeahead.js script for the autocomplete functionality.
Moment.js script for the current local time.

In the search field you can search states of US. And when you will press on the state name state name will be displayed otherwise error will occur.

Instructions
* Fork the repository
* Create a Feature Branch
* Implement a simple search function according to wireframes and UI (attached on github)
* The search should use a public REST API of your choice using JavaScript
* Search for title, return title (or something like that)
* Display partial search results in a list beneath the search field
* When hitting [ENTER] the selected search value should be saved with date/timestamp beneath the search box (as a search history)
* The page should be responsive, so that if width of window is changed it should adapt
* Nothing needs to be saved if the page is reloaded (i.e don’t have to use cookies/database etc)
 
What we look at
* How’s HTML/CSS/JS written?
* How is it packaged?
* General sanity check on structure and solution
* Is there a readme file giving enough instructions to start your solution?
 
Solve the task as far as you think is necessary. For this specific assignment focus on HTML/CSS, structure and good coding standards rather than advanced JS.
 
When done push your branch and let us know it’s done, e.g. by a pull request.
